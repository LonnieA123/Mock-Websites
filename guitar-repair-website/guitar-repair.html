                    <p>A 2020 NAMM Show score, this Fender Custom Shop 62 Jaguar Journeyman Relic is finished in Black and aged to perfection. It's vey much a quintessential Jaguar with some player friendly neck specs that make it a superb player. More pics coming soon!</p>
                    <p>A pair of period correct 1962 Jaguar Pickups are installed with the classic Jaguar wiring that intimidates some and inspires others. The lead circuit allows for some amazing tone shaping possibilities. A Master Volume and Master Tone are also on board.</p>
                    <p>The neck is made from Quarter Sawn Maple for added stability. It is topped with a nice, dark AAA rated rosewood fingerboard. The fingerboard radius is 9.5" and the frets are a set of 6150's. 24" scale length, 1.650" nut width, and 4 bolt neck design cover all the deets.</p>

                    <p>Up for sale is a sweet sounding 1972 Fender Musicmaster Bass in Dakota Red. I love these little 70s Musicmaster basses! They are simple and great sounding short scale instruments. This particualr example has some wear. Frets are fine. Upgraded with a Sentell pickup and a WD Custom pickguard. Strung with flat wounds.</p>
                    <p>The Fender Musicmaster Bass is a model of electric bass guitar, produced by Fender between 1971 and 1981. As with its six-string counterpart, which was a stripped-down version of the Fender Mustang, the Musicmaster Bass is a simpler version of the Mustang Bass. It features a short 30 in scale.</p>

                    <p>1971 Höfner 186 Telecaster Bass - Ivory Rare 1971 Höfner Model 186 bass in good condition and all original except for changed PU-selector switch. Copy of the than famous Telecaster bass in Ivory finish. Nice sound and great playability. The cracks in the pictures are only "weatherchecking" in the finish noc cracks in the wood! Comes in a gigbag. </p>
                    <p>The 500/1 Violin Bass was first shown to the public at the Frankfurt Muiskmesse in 1956. It has been in continuous production ever since. Designed by Walter Höfner as an alternative to the upright double bass it fulfilled this aim and much more. It leapt to worldwide fame when Paul McCartney was seen playing one with The Beatles in the early 1960s. Today the 500/1 is offered in a number of models from the budget Ignition version through to the handmade German built re-issues and specials. Its short scale (30in) and ultra lightweight has found favour with many professionals over the years.</p>
